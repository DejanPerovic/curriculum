# Choosing the Right Visualization

---
## Content

Data visualization is about telling stories with data. Let's look at some common scenarios:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Time series data
temperatures = [20, 22, 25, 27, 23]
plt.plot(temperatures)
plt.title("Temperature Over Time")
plt.show()
```

> ðŸ’¡ Different plots tell different stories!

Common visualization types and their uses:
- Line plots: Changes over time
- Bar plots: Comparing categories
- Scatter plots: Relationships between variables
- Pie charts: Parts of a whole

> ðŸ’¬ Think about these scenarios:
> - You're tracking your fitness progress
> - You're analyzing sales by product
> - You're comparing countries by GDP
>
> What type of visualization would you use for each? Why?
> Share your thoughts and see what others would choose!
