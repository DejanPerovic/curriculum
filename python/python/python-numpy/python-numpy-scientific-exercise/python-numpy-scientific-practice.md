    # Welcome to the Python coding playground
    # You're simulating projectile motion!
    # Tasks:
    # - Calculate trajectory of a projectile
    # - Find maximum height and distance
    # - Account for air resistance
    # - Analyze landing positions with random initial conditions

    # Type your code here:
    import numpy as np

    # Constants
    g = 9.81  # Gravitational acceleration (m/s²)
    v0 = 10.0  # Initial velocity (m/s)
    theta = np.pi/4  # Launch angle (45 degrees)

    # Time points
    t = np.linspace(0, 2, 100)  # 2 seconds of motion

## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to simulate and analyze projectile motion!

To solve this, try using:

- Vector calculations
- Physical constants
- Statistical analysis
- Random sampling

Give it a try, and feel free to experiment!

> 💡 Remember to consider both horizontal and vertical motion!

If you're stuck, try breaking it down:

1. Calculate basic trajectory
2. Find key points
3. Add air resistance
4. Analyze variations
