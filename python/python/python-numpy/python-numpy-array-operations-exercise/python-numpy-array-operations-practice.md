    # Welcome to the Python coding playground
    # You're analyzing stock market data!
    # Tasks:
    # - Calculate daily price changes
    # - Find stocks that gained/lost value
    # - Compare stock performances
    # - Calculate total market value

    # Type your code here:
    import numpy as np

    # Stock prices for 4 companies over 5 days
    prices = np.array([
        [100, 102, 98, 103, 105],  # Company A
        [50, 52, 49, 51, 48],      # Company B
        [75, 74, 77, 76, 80],      # Company C
        [25, 26, 24, 25, 27]       # Company D
    ])

    # Number of shares for each company (in thousands)
    shares = np.array([1000, 2000, 1500, 3000])

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to analyze stock market data using array operations!

To solve this, try using:

- Arithmetic operations for price changes
- Comparison operations for performance
- Logical operations for filtering
- Broadcasting for market value

Give it a try, and feel free to experiment!

> 💡 Remember that NumPy operations work on entire arrays at once!

If you're stuck, try breaking it down:

1. Calculate daily changes
2. Find winning/losing stocks
3. Compare performances
4. Compute market values
