# Image Masks

---

## Content

Use boolean masks to modify specific pixels:

Create mask:

```python
# Mask for bright pixels
bright_mask = image > 200
print(bright_mask)  # Array of True/False
```

> ğŸ’¡ Masks let you select pixels based on conditions!

Apply mask:

```python
# Set bright pixels to white
image_copy = image.copy()
image_copy[bright_mask] = 255
```

Combine masks:

```python
# Find medium brightness pixels
lower = image >= 100
upper = image <= 150
medium_mask = lower & upper
```

## Practice

Create a mask for dark pixels:

```python
dark = image ??? ???
```

- `<`
- `50`
- `>`
- `200`

## Revision

To modify pixels using a mask:

```python
mask = image > 200
image[???] = 255
```

- `mask`
- `where`
- `True`
- `filter`
