# Statistical Operations

---

## Content

NumPy has built-in statistical functions:

Find the mean (average):

```python
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
mean = arr.mean()
# 2.5
```

> ðŸ’¡ Statistical functions work on entire arrays at once!

Get minimum and maximum:

```python
arr = np.array([5, 2, 8, 1])
lowest = arr.min()  # 1
highest = arr.max() # 8
```

Calculate the sum:

```python
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])
total = arr.sum()  # 6
```

---

## Practice

Find the average value:

```python
arr = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8])
result = arr.???()
# 5.0
```

- `mean`
- `average`
- `med`
- `sum`

## Revision

To find the largest value in an array:

???

- `array.max()`
- `array.maximum()`
- `array.largest()`
- `array.big()`
