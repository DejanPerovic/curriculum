# Broadcasting Dimensions

---

## Content

Broadcasting with higher dimensions:

3D array with 1D:

```python
cube = np.array([[[1], [2]], [[3], [4]]])
vector = np.array([10, 20])
result = cube + vector
# array([[[11, 21],
#         [12, 22]],
#        [[13, 23],
#         [14, 24]]])
```

> ðŸ’¡ Missing dimensions are added from the left!

Shape matching:

```python
a = np.zeros((2, 1, 3))  # Shape: (2, 1, 3)
b = np.ones((3,))        # Shape: (3,)
# b is treated as (1, 1, 3)
result = a + b           # Works!
```

???

- (4,1,1)
- (4,2,3)
- (1,2,3)
- (4,2)

## Revision

Missing dimensions are added from:

???
