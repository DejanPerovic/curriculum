    # Welcome to the Python coding playground
    # You're analyzing temperature data!
    # Tasks:
    # - Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius (subtract 32, multiply by 5/9)
    # - Calculate daily temperature changes
    # - Find average, highest, and lowest temperatures
    # - Round the results

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to analyze temperature data using NumPy arrays!

To solve this, try using:

- Basic math operations (`*`, `-`, `/`)
- Statistical functions (`.mean()`, `.max()`, `.min()`)
- Rounding functions (`np.round()`, `np.floor()`)
- Array operations for daily changes

Give it a try, and feel free to experiment!

> 💡 Remember that NumPy operations work on entire arrays at once!

If you're stuck, try breaking it down:

1. Create an array of temperatures
2. Convert the temperatures
3. Calculate statistics
4. Round the results
