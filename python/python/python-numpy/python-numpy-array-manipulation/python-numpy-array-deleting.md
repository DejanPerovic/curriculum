# Deleting From Arrays

---

## Content

Remove elements from arrays:

Delete by index:

```python
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
new = np.delete(arr, 1)
# array([1, 3, 4])
```

> ðŸ’¡ Delete returns a new array without the specified elements!

Delete multiple elements:

```python
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
new = np.delete(arr, [1, 3])
# array([1, 3, 5])
```

Delete from 2D arrays:

```python
matrix = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
new = np.delete(matrix, 1, axis=0)
# array([[1, 2],
#        [5, 6]])
```

## Practice

Delete an element from the array:

```python
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
new = np.???(arr, ???)
# array([1, 3, 4])
```

## Revision

To delete a row from a 2D array:

```python
matrix = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
new = np.delete(matrix, 0, ???=0)
```
