    # Welcome to the Python coding playground
    # You're analyzing sales data across multiple stores!
    # Tasks:
    # - Apply discount to all prices
    # - Add seasonal adjustment factors
    # - Calculate sales tax per state
    # - Compare with target sales

    # Type your code here:
    import numpy as np

    # Sales data (3 stores x 4 products)
    sales = np.array([
        [100, 200, 150, 300],  # Store 1
        [150, 250, 200, 400],  # Store 2
        [125, 225, 175, 350]   # Store 3
    ])

    # Product base prices
    prices = np.array([10, 20, 15, 25])

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to analyze multi-store sales data using broadcasting!

To solve this, try using:

- Broadcasting with different shapes
- Array operations with scalars
- Row and column operations
- Shape compatibility rules

Give it a try, and feel free to experiment!

> 💡 Remember that broadcasting can work across multiple dimensions!

If you're stuck, try breaking it down:

1. Apply discounts to prices
2. Calculate per-store revenue
3. Add adjustments by store
4. Compare performance
