> 👩‍💻 Your task is to manage a game scoreboard using NumPy arrays!

To solve this, try using:

- `np.array()` to create the initial scores
- `np.append()` to add new players
- `np.delete()` to remove players
- `np.split()` to divide into teams

Give it a try, and feel free to experiment!

> 💡 Remember that most NumPy operations create new arrays!

If you're stuck, try breaking it down:

1. Start with a few players
2. Add one player at a time
3. Remove players who leave
4. Split remaining players into teams
