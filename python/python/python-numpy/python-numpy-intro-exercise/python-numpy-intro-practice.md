> 👩‍💻 Your task is to create a NumPy array and perform basic operations on it.

To solve this, try using:

- `np.array()` to create an array
- Array methods (`.sum()`, `.max()`)
- Array multiplication (`* 2`)

Give it a try, and feel free to experiment!

> 💡 Remember, NumPy operations work on the entire array at once.

Example solution:

```python
numbers = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
total = numbers.sum()
maximum = numbers.max()
doubled = numbers * 2

print(f"Sum: {total}")
print(f"Max: {maximum}")
print(f"Doubled: {doubled}")
```

If you're stuck, check the comments section or try breaking the problem into
smaller steps.
