    # Welcome to the Python coding playground
    # You're analyzing daily temperatures for a weather station!
    # Tasks:
    # - Create an array of daily temperatures
    # - Calculate the weekly average
    # - Find the hottest and coldest days
    # - Compare with last week's temperatures

    # Type your code here:
    import numpy as np

    # Last week's temperatures (°C)
    last_week = np.array([20, 21, 19, 22, 23, 21, 20])

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to analyze temperature data for a local weather station!

To solve this, try using:

- `np.array()` to store temperatures
- Array operations for calculations
- Comparison operators for analysis
- Statistical methods for averages

Give it a try, and feel free to experiment!

> 💡 Remember that NumPy makes working with data much easier than regular Python
> lists!

If you're stuck, try breaking it down:

1. Create this week's temperature array
2. Find average temperature
3. Compare with last week
4. Find temperature extremes
