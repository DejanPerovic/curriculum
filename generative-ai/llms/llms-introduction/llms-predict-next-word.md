# ðŸ¤– LLMs Predict the Next Word

---

## Content
An LLM predicts the next word based on the words that came before it.

It keeps doing this one word at a time until it completes its response.

For example:

```
The quick brown ???
```

The LLM might predict "fox" because it has learned the common phrase "The quick brown fox."

This process continues, word by word, to form a full response.

---

## Practice

The input is "The early bird ???". What would an LLM likely predict?

Use your own knowledge of the English language and the context of the sentence to make a prediction.

- catches the worm
- is super smart
- sings a song
- is not lazy
