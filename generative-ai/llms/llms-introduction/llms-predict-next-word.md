# ðŸ¤– LLMs Predict the Next Word

---

## Content

An LLM predicts the next word based on the words that came before it.

It keeps doing this one word at a time until it completes its response.

For example:

```
The quick brown ???
```

The LLM might predict "fox" because it has learned the common phrase "The quick brown fox."

This process continues, word by word, to form a full response.

---

## Practice

The input is "The early bird ...". What would an LLM likely predict as the next word?

The early bird ???

- catches
- is
- sings
- isn't
