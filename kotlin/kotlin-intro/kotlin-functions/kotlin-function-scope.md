# Function Scope

---
## Content

Variables defined inside a function are only accessible within that function.

This is known as **function scope**.

```kotlin
fun calculateArea(length: Int, width: Int): Int {
    val area = length * width
    return area
}
```

Here, the variable area is created inside the function and cannot be accessed outside of it.

> ðŸ’¡ Function Scope: Limits the visibility of variables to the function where they are defined.

Scope is useful because it reduces conflicts by separating variables in different parts of the program.

## Practice

Function scope determines the ??? of variables within a function.

???

- `visibility`
- `type`
- `value`

## Revision

What is the scope of the variable `area` in the following function?

```kotlin
fun calculateArea(length: Int, width: Int): Int {
    val area = length * width
    return area
}
```

???

- Within the `calculateArea` function
- Throughout the entire program
- Within the `main` function
