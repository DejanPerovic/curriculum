# Basic String Methods

---
## Content

Kotlin offers methods to manipulate strings, like changing case or finding length. These are like tools in a toolbox, each serving a specific purpose.

- **`length`**: Get the number of characters, like counting the letters in a word.
- **`toUpperCase()`**: Convert to uppercase, similar to shouting a word.
- **`toLowerCase()`**: Convert to lowercase, like whispering a word.

```kotlin
val text = "hello"
println(text.toUpperCase()) // Outputs: HELLO
println(text.length) // Outputs: 5
```

**Why it matters:** These methods help format and analyze text data, much like editing a document to ensure it looks just right.
