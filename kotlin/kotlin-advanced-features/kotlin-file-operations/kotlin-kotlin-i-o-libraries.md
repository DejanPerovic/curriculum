# Kotlin I/O Libraries ðŸ“š

---
## Content

Kotlin provides libraries to make file operations easy, like having a toolkit for handling books. The `java.io` package is commonly used for file handling.

Here's a quick look:

```kotlin
import java.io.File
import java.io.IOException
```

- **`java.io.File`**: This class represents a file or directory path.
- **`java.io.IOException`**: Handles errors during input/output operations.
