# COUNTUNIQUE

---
## Content

The `=COUNTUNIQUE()` function operates like the `=COUNT()` function except that it only counts unique values.

Syntax:
```spreadsheet
COUNTUNIQUE(value1, value2, ...)
```

Only the first value is required, but you can add as many as you want.

The `value1` can be a single cell, a range of cells, or manually inputted numbers/text.

## Practice

Finish the code to only count unique values from cell `A1` to `D99`.

```spreadsheet
???(???)
```

* =COUNTUNIQUE
* A1:D99
* =COUNT_UNIQUE
* A1-D99
* A1, D99
