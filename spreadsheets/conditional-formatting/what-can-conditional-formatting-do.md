# What Can Conditional Formatting do

---
## Content

Conditional formatting can be used to automatically apply different formatting.

As mentioned before, conditional formatting works like an `if-then` logical expression.

`if` something is true `then` do something.

Conditional formatting works with `rules`. 

1 `rule` = 1 `if-then` condition

You can create as many `rules` as you want.

You can create `rules` that change the color of a cell to red if the value is not the value you need and green if it is.

You can create different color-coding systems for different `rules`.

Anytime a certain cell value is updated you can color the text and/or cell, bold it, underline, and more. 

You can also manually input formulas to create specific conditions that spreadsheets don't offer by default.
