There are several date and time functions in Spreadsheets.
 - TIME()
 - NOW()
 - TODAY()
 - HOUR()
 - MINUTE()
 - SECOND()
 - YEAR()
 - MONTH()
 - WEEKDAY()
 - DATE()

They can be used to get the current date and/or time, extract any part of a date like seconds or minutes, convert numbers to dates and more.

The `=TIME()` function is used to convert numbers to time.
