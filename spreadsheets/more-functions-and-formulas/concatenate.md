# CONCATENATE

## Content

## Practice

The `=CONCATENATE()` function is used to combine data from 2 or more cells into one cell.

Syntax:
```spreadsheet
CONCATENATE(string1, string2, ...)
```

You can add single cells, a range of cells, or input strings directly into the function.

Only the `string1` is mandatory all others are optional.

> 💡 You can also add a delimiter like space or dash or anything else.

In the above example, we combined the values of 3 cells, `A1:C1` and separated the first 2 cells with a space and the 2nd and third with a comma.
