# Importing .csv Files

---
## Content

A `.csv`, or a `Comma Separated Values` file, is a plain text file. `.csv` files can serve as a database where each entry of the database is separated with commas.

Here is an example of a `.csv` file opened in a simple text editor.

We can import that file to a spreadsheet and then read that data using spreadsheets numerous features.

To import a `.csv` file, go to `File` -> `Import`.

Next, a pop-up window will appear asking you to select a file.

There are 4 ways to import a file, we are going to choose the `Upload` option highlighted below.

After your file has been uploaded a new pop-up window will appear asking you to select several "importing options".

At the top you have your file name. 

Next, you have an `import location`. You have several options to chose from. We will choose the `Insert new sheet(s)` one.

Then we have a `separator type`. We can choose what spreadsheets considers as a separator to know how to populate the cells. We will let spreadsheets detect them automatically.

The last option is used to tell spreadsheets to convert text from the updated file into number, dates, and formulas.

When we press `Import Data` the above file looks like this:

> Text files (`.txt`) have the same import options as `.csv` files.

## Practice

What are `.csv` Files?

* `Comma Separated Values` files similar to plain text files
* `Comma Separated Variables` files similar to HTML files.
