# PROPER

## Content

The `=PROPER()` function is used to re-format text.

Syntax:
```spreadsheet
=PROPER(text)
```

If we had `mY naME Is SteFAN` in cell `A1`, typing `=PROPER(A1)` would re-format the text into `My Name is Stefan`.

This function is best used when you need to capitalize every word of a cell.
