Now that we know how to add more data, we can better visualize it by modifying our chart.

The chart from the previous insight:

![previous-chart](https://img.enkipro.com/a8f69242523d86c29148a4c3544b41eb.png)

In the `Chart editor`, we have a `Customize` tab.

> ðŸ’¡ The `Customize` tab is different for each chart type.

![customize](https://img.enkipro.com/01638b7e174af98dffa0959033fa9590.png)

Here, we can customize our chart with different styling, change the axis, modify the series, and more.

In the `Chart style` tab we can modify the lines of our chart and make them smooth.

This tab also allows us to maximize the chart, change the background color, fonts, border color, and plot null values.

In the `Charts & axis titles` we can modify the title and subtitle of the chart, change their font type, size, color, and format.

We have made the title bold and added a subtitle:

Next we have the `Series` tab. Here we can:
- edit how the data is shown
- how thick the lines will be
- show plot points
- add different formating 
- add visual representation per data point
- show errors
- and more.

![series](https://img.enkipro.com/090c3c6dcb063477a22f83f19e398bce.png)

We are going to leave the `Apply to all series` and add a `Point size` of `7px` and make the `Point shape` `Diamond` for all series.

Then we are going to select the `Number Of Employees` from the drop-down menu and tick the `Data labels` checkbox to display all the values above each data point.

After the above customization, our chart looks like this:
