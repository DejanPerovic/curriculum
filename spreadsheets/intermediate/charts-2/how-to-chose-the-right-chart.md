# How to chose the right chart?

---
## Content

When choosing the right chart, there are several things you have to keep in mind.

The amount of data you want to use for the chart, what the chart is about, do you want to show a change over time, summarize things, how you want to scale, and many more.

Each chart type is used for a particular type of data.

Pie charts are best used when you want to compare parts of a whole.
 
Pie charts do not show changes over time or similar data, they are used to show what percentage of 100 has something been done or whatever your chart is about.

Line charts are best used to display a change over time. You could check if your company's profit is going up or down based on 2 or more entries.

This chart shows changes in profit over a three year period:

If we used a pie chart to display the above data, it would look like this:

Choosing the right chart is key.

To determine what chart you need, you need to determine what data you have. 

If you are not sure which chart to use, you can always test all the charts with the data you have and best decide on the one that suits you.

To change the type of the chart, click on the 3 dots located at the top right of the chart and select `edit chart`.

This will open the `Chart Editor` menu.

At the top you have a `Chart type` drop-down menu.

Here you can select the chart you want.

When the new type is selected, the chart is instantly updated:
