The `Color scale` tab is the second tab in the `Conditional format rules` tab.

On this tab, you can select the range and apply formatting.

You can preview how the colors change on the `preview` bar.

You can also add a custom color rule on the `preview` bar.

Next you have the min, middle and max values. Here you can create a 3 color rule. However, only the min and max values are required.

Each of the 3 points have a `Percent`, `Percentile` and `Number` conditions.

The `minpoint` has a `Min value`, the `maxpoint` a `Max value` and the `midpoint` a `none` condition.
