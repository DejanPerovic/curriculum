# TO_TEXT

---
## Content

The `TO_TEXT` function is used to convert a number to a text value.

Syntax:
```plain-text
TO_TEXT(value)
```

The `value` can be a manually inputted argument or a reference to a cell to be converted to a text value.

The `TO_TEXT` function converts numerical values to strings whilst retaining any formatting the `value` has had before. Dates remain dates, currencies remain currencies, percentages remain percentages and decimals remain decimals.

If you are referencing a non-number cell or manually input something other than a number, the function will just return the `value` as it was.
