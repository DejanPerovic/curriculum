# TO_PERCENT

---
## Content

The `TO_PERCENT` function is used to convert a number to a percentage.

Syntax:
```plain-text
TO_PERCENT(value)
```

The `value` can be a manually inputted argument or a reference to a cell to be converted to a percent value.

`value` = 0 is 0% and `value` = 1 is 100%.

If you are referencing a non-number cell or manually input something other than a number, the function will just return the `value` as is.
