# TO_PURE_NUMBER

---
## Content

The `TO_PURE_NUMBER` function is used to convert a date/time, percentage, currency, or other formatted numeric value to a pure number without any formatting.

Syntax:
```plain-text
TO_PURE_NUMBER(value)
```

The `value` can be a manually inputted argument or a reference to a cell to be converted to a pure value.

If you are referencing a numeric `value`, the `TO_PURE_NUMBER` function removes all formatting and returns the `value`.

If you are referencing a non-number cell or manually input something other than a number, the function will just return the `value` as it was.
