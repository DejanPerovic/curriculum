# The POWER function 

---
## Content

The POWER function is used to raise a number to a specified power.

Syntax:
```spreadsheet
POWER(base, exponent)
```

The `base` is the number to be raised to the `exponent` power.

The `exponent` determines to what power to raise the `base` to.

> TLDR LAMP If the `base` is a negative number, the `exponent` must be an integer. If the `base` is a positive number, the `exponent` can be a decimal number.
