# The FLOOR Function

---
## Content

The `=FLOOR()` function is used to round a number down to a specified integer or decimal place.

Syntax:
```spreadsheets
FLOOR(value, factor)
```

The `value` is the value to round down. You can manually input a number or select a cell.

> TLDR LAMP The `value` can be a positive or negative number.

The `factor` value is optional and is set to 1 by default. This value determines up to what decimal the value is rounded down. 

> TLDR LAMP The `factor` value must be a positive number higher than `0`.
