# The CEILING Function

---
## Content

The `=CEILING()` function is used to round a number up to a specified integer or decimal place.

Syntax:
```spreadsheets
CEILING(value, factor)
```

The `value` is the value to round down. You can manually input a number or select a cell.

The `factor` value is optional. This value determines up to what decimal the `value` is rounded up. 

> TLDR LAMP The `factor` value is `1` by default and can never be `0`.

When the `value` is positive, the `factor` must be positive. When the `value` is negative, the `factor` can be either positive or negative.
